returning to it's starting area and releasing the mug safely.

Use streamlit run with whatever path is relevant for the program in terminal to run the full program

This runs best when 1 meter = 1 pixel. I would reccomend using a pixel art program/website to create mazes. If made into a png, make sure the inside of the maze is colored in white.
